First lecture of Namaste React where we learnerd
1]When we create a element it is basically a object
2]react is libarary not a framework
3]If you have already written some code is suppose root id in index.html file and suppose if we are making the same tag or fetching the same element and making it as root and rendering it then whatever it was initially inside the root id element in index.html file will get replaced by code in the react file as we render it
4]It will not change any data which is outside the root element or the element which we have described as a root
5]Git and GITHUB are DIFFERENt
6]CDN -- content delivery Network basically they are the servers which are located at the nearby locations
         a]CDN is very imp as it makes our websites very fast
         b]We dont have to connect to main server to get the data 
         c]Increases security
         d]Decreases load on main server
7]react and react-dom -
      a]react link in cdn links basically contains the very core code which need to be there for react dev
      b]react dom links contains the code which is required for making changes in our dom of the page
8]We use JSX in our react dev beacause it makes our life easy
